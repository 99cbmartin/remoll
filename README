---------------------------------------------------


Packages to build this:

>=Geant4.9.5
cmake > 2.6
root
python
git (optional)

---------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

To build, create the directory you would like to 
build in, say build

mkdir build
cd build
cmake <path to remoll>
make

Field maps can be found here:

http://hallaweb.jlab.org/12GeV/Moller/downloads/remoll/

An example macro will be found in 

macros/

You need to load libremollroot.so if you want to access 
the classes written out to the ROOT files.  Building
remoll will create a rootlogon.C which will do this
automatically.

Visualization

Visualization macros are found in vis/

To run, execute

./remoll 

which should bring up a graphical command interface
Then you can run

/control/execute vis/Qt.mac

Troubleshooting:

if you get errors about missing gitinfo.hh try

cmake <path to remoll>
make
